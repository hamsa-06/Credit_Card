# Credit Card Fraud: Analysis and Prevention

**Overview**<br>
Credit card fraud is a growing concern in digital commerce, threatening financial security and consumer trust. This project analyzes patterns of fraudulent transactions using a dataset of 100,000 transactions. The goal is to identify key fraud indicators using SQL queries and develop insights for fraud detection and prevention.

**Analysis Objectives Using SQL** <br>
  **1. Data Exploration & EDA**<br>
  1.1. What does the dataset look like?<br>
  1.2. How many total transactions are there, and what percentage are fraudulent?<br>
  1.3. What are the minimum, maximum, average, and median transaction amounts?<br>
  1.4. Which locations have the highest percentage of fraudulent transactions?<br>
  1.5. How does fraud vary over time?<br>
  
  **2. Pattern Recognition**<br>
  2.1. Which merchants have the highest fraud rates?<br>
  2.2. Are there specific transaction amounts frequently associated with fraud?<br>
  2.3. Which transaction types have the highest fraud percentages?<br>
  
 **3. Fraud Detection Modeling Insights**<br>
  3.1. How diverse is the dataset in terms of unique merchants, locations, and transaction types?<br>
  3.2. Are there any fraudulent transactions with significantly high amounts?<br>
  3.3. Which merchants have been involved in multiple fraudulent transactions?<br>

**Conclusion**<br>
This project highlights the importance of SQL-driven fraud detection in securing financial transactions. By leveraging SQL queries for pattern recognition, fraud analysis,<br> and anomaly detection, it aims to enhance fraud prevention strategies.
