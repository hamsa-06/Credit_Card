# Credit Card Fraud: Analysis and Prevention

**Overview**
Credit card fraud is a growing concern in digital commerce, threatening financial security and consumer trust. This project analyzes patterns of fraudulent transactions using a dataset of 100,000 transactions. The goal is to identify key fraud indicators using SQL queries and develop insights for fraud detection and prevention.

**Analysis Objectives Using SQL** 
  **1. Data Exploration & EDA**
  1.1. What does the dataset look like?
  1.2. How many total transactions are there, and what percentage are fraudulent?
  1.3. What are the minimum, maximum, average, and median transaction amounts?
  1.4. Which locations have the highest percentage of fraudulent transactions?
  1.5. How does fraud vary over time?
  
  **2. Pattern Recognition**
  2.1. Which merchants have the highest fraud rates?
  2.2. Are there specific transaction amounts frequently associated with fraud?
  2.3. Which transaction types have the highest fraud percentages?
  
 **3. Fraud Detection Modeling Insights**
  3.1. How diverse is the dataset in terms of unique merchants, locations, and transaction types?
  3.2. Are there any fraudulent transactions with significantly high amounts?
  3.3. Which merchants have been involved in multiple fraudulent transactions?

**Conclusion**
This project highlights the importance of SQL-driven fraud detection in securing financial transactions. By leveraging SQL queries for pattern recognition, fraud analysis, and anomaly detection, it aims to enhance fraud prevention strategies.
